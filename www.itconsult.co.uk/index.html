<P>I. T. Consultancy Limited is based in Jersey in the Channel Islands and provides independent advice and practical assistance, to its clients, in the areas of information technology and communications.  In order to ensure its independence, it sells no goods of any sort and derives its whole income from time based fees.</P>
<P>It operates <A HREF="https://stamper.itconsult.co.uk">Stamper</A>, a free PGP digital timestamping service, which now
includes RFC3161 timestamping.</P>
<P>It also provides an <A HREF="mailto:ping@stamper.itconsult.co.uk">email pinging service</A> which will return any message received to the sender including full headers.  This might be useful for testing email systems.</P>
<p>
My <a href="itconsult-keys.asc">PGP keys</a> contain both my current key 1C90F3BE100FB9ADF8379DAE2A34FA1BDA26CF63 as well as my
previous, and original key from 1994 0712FEBD.  Their respective fingerprints are "1C90 F3BE 100F B9AD F837  9DAE 2A34 FA1B DA26 CF63"
and "BC DB 9E 23 7B 76 4E 8E  F4 05 BC 6F 8A D7 1B 0D".  Only the current key will import into GnuPG version 2, but both will import
into GnuPG version 1.4 with the "--pgp2" flag.  Doing so, 
<a href="key-import.txt">will show</a> that the current key has been signed by the original key.
</p>
<p>
As a historical aside, my original key <i>0712FEBD</i>
is listed in
<a href=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/OLD/Trust-Register/gtr1998.pdf>The Global Trust Register 1988</a>.
